# Wine Quality Clustering

This project applies clustering techniques to analyze the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/)
- **Description**: Contains physicochemical properties and quality ratings for red wine samples.

## Project Overview

The goal is to explore patterns in the dataset using:
- **Preprocessing Techniques**: Normalization, Transformation, PCA.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-Means, Hierarchical, Mean-Shift.
